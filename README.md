# Date Picker Component
As an engineer, I want to have access to a reusable date picker component, so that I can produce more DRY code.

## Acceptance Criteria

 - Must display date in a MM/DD/YYYY format
 - Must have a button to open a date picker window that can be used to select a day
 - Must also support typing directly into the input
 - Must have styles compatible with dark and light mode (consider adding a switch for dev purposes)
 - Must be a 2 color format, a base light or dark color with an accent color
 - Accent color must be configurable by passing a prop to the component
 - Component should accept a MIN and MAX date prop, with validation that the chosen date is between them if passed

## Description
Spread Dev Inc is building a component library for use in future products. We have the business need for consistent styling across our apps, and one of the common features is a date picker for forms. Apart from the specified color configurations in the acceptance criteria, exact design is open to interpretation by the developer, but you may find inspiration [here](https://open-ui.org/static/antd-datepicker-basic-d4c1db84c8b8c461ee74091be0ddf812.gif).
